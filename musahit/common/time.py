"""Timestamp helpers — the project-wide UTC-naive convention.

MÜŞAHİT is a single-machine pipeline (ADR-001) that stores every timestamp in
DuckDB. DuckDB's ``TIMESTAMP`` column is **timezone-naive**: writing a
timezone-aware Python datetime causes a silent conversion to the host's local
time before storage. On the operator's UTC+3 machine that means an 08:00 UTC
publish time is persisted as 11:00 — and reading it back gives a tz-naive
datetime that downstream code can no longer tell apart from an honest UTC
value. This was caught during step-4 RSS work and is the reason both
``raw_articles.fetched_at`` and ``raw_articles.canonical_timestamp`` had to
strip ``tzinfo`` before insert.

This module is the single source of that conversion. Every component that
writes a timestamp to DuckDB — every ingester (steps 4-7), the cluster stage
(step 9), the arc-link stage (step 10), the briefing renderer (step 13) —
imports from here. The convention:

- :func:`utcnow` is the only way to ask "what time is it now?" The result is
  a naive datetime whose value is the current UTC moment.
- :func:`to_utc_naive` normalizes a possibly-aware datetime (e.g. one parsed
  from an RSS feed) into the same naive-UTC shape before persisting it.

If a future stage needs timezone-aware datetimes (UI layer, audit exports,
etc.) it should re-attach ``UTC`` at the boundary — but **never** write a
tz-aware datetime back to DuckDB.

See ADR-001 (architecture overview, single-machine local pipeline).

    Behavior matrix:

    - ``None`` → ``None``. Callers can pass through optional values without
      a guard.

      datetimes are already in UTC; the helper does not second-guess the
      caller's bookkeeping (this matches how :class:`datetime` itself
      treats naive values — interpretation is the caller's job).
    - Tz-aware input → converted to UTC, then ``tzinfo`` stripped. The
      stored instant is the same; only the representation changes.

        dt: A naive or tz-aware datetime, or ``None``.

    Returns:
        ``None`` if input was ``None``, otherwise a naive datetime whose
